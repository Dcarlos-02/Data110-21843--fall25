# Final Project: **Data Storytelling Mastery**

## Introduction

Welcome to your Final Project! This is your chance to showcase the full spectrum of data science skills you've developed throughout the course—from cleaning and exploring data to building clear, compelling visual narratives. The focus is not just on making charts, but on crafting a *story* supported by meaningful, well-structured, and interactive visuals. You’ll apply everything you've learned to engage your audience and communicate your insights with clarity and purpose.

## Objective

Your task is to select a dataset, perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and present your findings through **interactive and static data visualizations** that build a cohesive narrative. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships, and turn them into an engaging and informative data story.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Dataset Selection
- Choose a dataset aligned with your interests or select one from [Prof. Rachel’s Dataset Collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AMRfddeMwKRaNidOV87JP1iCVn_z-Uv_).
- You may also choose datasets from public repositories like Kaggle, the UCI Machine Learning Repository, or government open data portals.
- Ensure the dataset is sufficiently complex to allow for meaningful analysis and storytelling.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform an in-depth EDA to understand the structure, distribution, and interrelationships within your data.
- Focus on insights that lend themselves to storytelling—what questions does your data raise, and what answers can you find?

### 3. Data Visualization (Interactive + Static)
- Create at least **five well-designed visualizations**, including **at least two interactive visualizations**.
- For interactivity, you may use **Tableau**, **Plotly**, or mapping libraries in Python such as **Folium**, **Altair**, or **geopandas**.
- Use a variety of visualization types (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, line charts, treemaps, choropleth maps, Sankey diagrams).
- Each visualization must include clear titles, axis labels, legends (if needed), and a concise caption explaining what it shows and why it matters.

### 4. Final Report
- Submit a structured, polished report that includes:
  - Introduction to your dataset and your motivation for selecting it.
  - Overview of your EDA process and key findings.
  - Detailed discussion of each visualization and the insights they reveal.
  - A conclusion tying together the main takeaways and suggesting possible next steps or further questions to explore.
- Include all code used for data manipulation and visualization in an appendix or linked Jupyter Notebook/Colab file.

### 5. Presentation
- Prepare a **7-minute presentation** summarizing your project.
- Limit your main content to **8 slides max** (excluding title and conclusion).
- Your presentation should include:
  - A quick overview of your dataset and analysis goals.
  - Key interactive and static visualizations.
  - A strong narrative arc that explains the “so what?” of your findings.
- You may use PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote, or an interactive presentation tool like [Slides.com](https://slides.com/).
- **Before the presentation day**, you must **submit a recorded version** of your talk (screen recording or voiceover slideshow). This ensures preparedness and serves as a backup.

## Submission Guidelines

Submit the following items **by the final project deadline**:
- Final report (PDF, HTML, or Jupyter Notebook) keep it in Github
- Presentation slides ( link)
- **Recorded presentation video** (MP4, YouTube link, or Google Drive link)
- Code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (submitted via GitHub or Google Colab)

Ensure your code is clean, commented, and reproducible.

# Final Project Rubric and Evaluation Criteria

## Rubric

| Evaluation       | Criterion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Points |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Outstanding**  | Submitted on time. Dataset is rich and appropriate. EDA is deep and thoughtful. Visualizations are well-designed, interactive, and impactful. Clear narrative throughout. Report is polished, coherent, and insightful. All technical and storytelling aspects are addressed.                                                              | 100    |
| **Proficient**   | Dataset is relevant and analysis is focused. Visualizations are clear and useful, including at least one interactive element. Narrative is logical and well-supported. Report communicates ideas clearly. Minor improvements needed in depth or polish.                                                                         | 80     |
| **Developing**   | Dataset may lack depth or relevance. EDA and visualizations are somewhat informative but may miss key insights or storytelling clarity. Interactive elements are missing or weak. Report lacks structure or depth.                                                                                                                | 60     |
| **Insufficient** | Project is late or incomplete. Dataset is too simple or poorly analyzed. Visuals are underdeveloped, missing, or lack clarity. Report is disorganized or fails to communicate insights. Requirements not met.                                                                                                                    | 40     |

## Important Notes

- **Interactive visualization is required**: At least 3 of your 5 visualizations must be interactive. This can be achieved using Tableau, Plotly, or map-based visual tools in Python.
- **This project is your capstone**: It reflects both your technical ability and your communication skills. Treat it as a portfolio piece.
